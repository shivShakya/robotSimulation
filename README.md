In this project, robotic hands controlled via user inputs were developed for computer graphics and computational geometry subjects. 
To enhance it, integrate real-time collision detection algorithms for safe interactions with the environment.
Implement intuitive control interfaces like gesture recognition to improve user interaction. 
Additionally, explored inverse kinematics for more natural hand movements and advanced rendering techniques for heightened visual realism.
